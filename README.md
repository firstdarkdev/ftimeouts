# F**k Timeouts

Slow connections and getting kicked from servers pissing you off? Well, time to say "F**k TIMEOUTS"!

This SERVER SIDE mod contains the connection timeout configuration from Random Patches standalone because it hasn't updated to 1.18.

This mod is for internal use only, but, if you REALLY need it, download it from our [Jenkins](https://ci.firstdarkdev.xyz/job/FTimeouts/).
